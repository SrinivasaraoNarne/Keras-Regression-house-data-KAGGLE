# Keras-Regression-house-data-KAGGLE
This project demonstrates how to use a Keras-based Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to predict house prices using a dataset from Kaggle. The dataset includes features like square footage, number of bedrooms, bathrooms, location, and other property attributes.
# Overview
The project aims to build a regression model using Keras to predict house prices based on historical data. This project involves:

  * Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
  * Building and training a regression ANN model.
  * Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R².
# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains the following features:

  * Numerical features: sqft_living, sqft_lot, bedrooms, bathrooms, etc.
  * Categorical features: zipcode, view, condition, etc.
  * Target variable: price (house price in USD).
  * Data: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
# Project Workflow
1. Data Preprocessing:
   * Handled missing values.
   * Applied feature scaling and normalization.
   * Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA).
2. Model Building:
   * Created an ANN with Keras for regression.
   * Optimized hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of layers.
3. Evaluation:
   * Evaluated the model using metrics like MSE, RMSE, and R².
4. Prediction:
   * Used the trained model to predict house prices on test data.
# Technologies Used
  * Programming Language: Python
  * Libraries: Keras, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
  * Environment: Jupyter Notebook / Python IDE
